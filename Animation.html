  <h1>Animation</h1>
  <p>Animation is another art form that Payton is skilled in. Only having just started learning and honing her skills in this field, Payton is working hard to learn skills both in school and on her own time. Animation is an art form that Payton enjoys both working in and observing and she hopes to one day develop her skills far enough to work in the animation industry. </p>
  <p id="text">The short film seen here is titled <i>Habitat. Habitat</i> is a minute-long short film Payton created for a summer introductory animation course. The film follows a fox as it navigates a changing landscape when human expansion begins to take over its natural habitat. The fox is seen waking up in a starlit field to the lights and noises of a landing plane, disrupting his peaceful sleep and scaring him away. The fox ends up on a busy city street, searching for somewhere safe to rest among the noise and bustle of the city. The fox first searches in an alleyway for something to eat, searching in a dumpster before being interrupted by a human with a flashlight. The fox runs off, spooked, and has to run across a busy street while dodging cars. Landing safely on the other side of the street, the fox bounds into another alleyway, this one more secluded. He looks back at the direction he came, taking a moment to recuperate before turning and heading off into the night. The film ends with a pan-up of the city’s night sky, the same sky seen at the beginning of the film. Only this time, the sparking stars are faded and few due to the lights of the city that have overtaken their natural beauty. </p>
  <p>The idea behind this film is to show how the expansion of human cities and industry impacts our natural world. When humans expand their cities and homes into natural spaces, like meadows and forests, the nature and animals that live there need somewhere to go. They have to either adapt to this sudden and rapidly changing world that we’ve created, or they die. Foxes are one of those animals that have to adapt to live alongside us in our cities and towns, abandoning skills and instincts that they used in the wild and trying to fit into a world where they’re clearly not welcome. From their typical food sources becoming scarce and having to take up scavenging, living off food scraps from us that they were never meant to be eating, to having to navigate countless dangers like traffic and people who think of them as pests and want them gone. Our invasion of these natural spaces and refusal to leave substantial space for nature to thrive has driven many animals into this sad and undesirable life where they’re not meant to thrive or even survive at all. With this film, Payton aims to draw attention to this injustice that so many animals face in today’s day and age and hopefully inspire others to treat these animals forced to live in our cities with kindness and compassion. </p>
