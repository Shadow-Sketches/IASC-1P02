	<h1> Illustration </h1>
<p>Illustration is one of the many artistic skills that Payton has. Specializing in digital illustrations, Payton’s work features a cartoon-like, graphic style. Emphasizing expression of emotions and feelings over a more realistic approach. Many of her works also feature vibrant, saturated colours that are bright and pleasing to look at as well as dramatic lighting that helps to create mood and add atmosphere to the drawings. Shown here are three examples of some of Payton’s recent illustration work.</p>
<p id="text">The first is an illustration of the popular character Sallie May from the web series titled <i>Helluva Boss</i>. Shown in her signature look from the short <i>Hell’s Belles</i>, Sallie May is depicted in a setting with dramatic and vibrant lighting, a purple spotlight shining down on her from above with a green spotlight casting a glow from the bottom left. She’s backlit by these spotlights, being cast mostly in shadow with the exception of her one visible glowing eye, creating a striking point of contrast and focusing the viewer’s attention on her face. The piece also features some interesting, experimental elements in the background with the lighting. Instead of a simple gradient glow to the lights, Payton has added in a dotted effect, giving the lights a unique, comic-ey feel to them. It adds to the fun, playful element of the work and ties the whole piece together.</p>
<p >The next illustration is one titled, <i>We’ll See</i>. This work features the character Vaggie from the television series <i>Hazbin Hotel</i>. Vaggie is depicted standing on a balcony, looking up at a glowing moth on a cloudy night, while the faint form of Heaven can be seen obscured by the clouds. This piece is a symbolic reflection of Vaggie’s character. Vaggie is an angel who was cast out of Heaven after questioning their way of doing things. While living in Hell, Vaggie changed and grew, learning that what she was taught wasn’t the whole truth and found a family among those she once hated and feared.  Her story is reflected in the piece through the background elements. Vaggie is seen gazing up at the glowing moth in this illustration, representative of the new life that she’s found and built for herself. Meanwhile, her former home is hidden by clouds in the distance. Still a part of her life and who she is, but no longer how she defines herself or the focus of her life. </p>
<p >The final illustration is called <i>Migration</i>. It features a family of dragons flying across a mountainous landscape under the cover of night. The dragons are illuminated by the light of the moon, highlighting them against the darker background and bringing them into focus for the viewer while the background is allowed to fall away. The colour palette seen in this illustration is very analogous and cool, giving the piece a calm sense of serenity and peace. In contrast to how dragons are typically depicted in media as fire-breathing, ferocious beasts, this piece gives the opposite feeling to these creatures. The cool palette and soft shapes and lines give the dragons a sense of wonder and serenity to them. Making them feel more like something to be appreciated and treasured than feared and hated. </p>
