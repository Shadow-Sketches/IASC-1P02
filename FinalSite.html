	<h1>About the Artist</h1>
	<p>Payton Young is an interdisciplinary artist who works primarily in digital mediums but has been known to occasionally dabble in traditional as well. With experience in multiple areas, from illustration to graphic design, photography, and even animation, Payton has a wide range of skills that can be applied to any number of different ideas and projects. </p>
	<p>She started off her art career as many artists. Drawing and creating endlessly as a kid. It wasn’t until the end of elementary school that she started taking art seriously, becoming interested in sculpting her own dragons. Inspired by the work of Dragons and Beasties, Payton spent two years growing her skills with sculpture. Then in high school, she decided to drop sculpture in favour of a new art form.</p>
	<p>Payton stumbled across the work of internet star Vivienne Medrano and her indie animation project Hazbin Hotel while taking art classes in high school. Payton instantly fell in love with the unique character designs and expressive animation of Vivienne Medrano’s work and from there decided that she wanted to pursue a career in animation and illustration. </p>
	<p>She began teaching herself how to draw like Vivienne. Studying her art style and methods and the methods of those like her. Learning how to make digital and traditional art. Teaching herself anatomy, lighting, shapes and lines. All to improve her skills and get into an art school where she could take her skills even further and earn a degree to work in the animation and illustration industry. Payton’s art works and style continue to be heavily influenced and inspired by the works of Vivienne Medrano to this day.</p>
	<p>Being an artist who tends to focus primarily on digital work, Payton is proficient in multiple different programs, like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere Pro, Reaper, and more. Her current favourite program to turn to in order to make digital art is Procreate. </p>
	<p>Although she’s mostly self-taught in many areas, Payton got into and has been attending Brock University’s Visual Arts program, where she’s learning skills that have greatly impacted how she makes and thinks about art today. Taking classes ranging from traditional drawing and painting techniques to more specialized art forms, like darkroom photography, animation, sound design, video art, and more. Payton hopes to graduate from Brock University in 2026 and go on to pursue further education in a more specialized program for animation. She’s not quite sure what she would like to specialize in just yet, but she’s considering multiple options, like storyboarding, character animation, background design, creature animation, or whatever else comes her way.</p>
	<p>Payton is currently working on getting her own online store up and running, alongside finishing school. She hopes to sell prints, stickers, keychains, and possibly pins of her drawings and designs as a way to earn money from her art alongside her career. Payton also hopes that after finishing school and gaining some skills in animation, she will be able to join the independent production company Spindle Horse, which was created and is run by Vivienne Medrano. </p>
